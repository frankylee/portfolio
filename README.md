### Software Engineer

Hello! I am a Fullstack Software Engineer committed to building products that improve the world in a positive and meaningful way. I have experience in frontend web technologies and UX/UI Design, but 2020 encouraged me to branch into backend and further develop my programming skills as I transition from front-end web developer to fullstack software engineer.

In my off time, I enjoy contributing to community-based projects via open source and hackathon events. I'm also a hobbyist photographer with an affinity for starscapes, landscapes, and nature. At home, you might find me tending to houseplants.

Thanks for visiting!
